# visualizing-sorting-algorithms
i used pygame to visualize some popular comparison based algorithms.

i did not created GUI as i just wanted to see how they works.

explanation of main function: 

~binary_insertion_sort_not_visualized(bars, 0 , no_of_bars-1)

~reverse(bars, 0 , no_of_bars-1)

These two functions are not visualized

~bars.sort(reverse=True)

~bars.sort()

These two functions are inbuilt python function.

The main purpose of using/creating these function was to check performance and behaviour of sorting algorithms in already sorted/reversed or partially sorted/reversed array.

The rest commented funtions are visualized sorting algorithms using pygame library. Just uncomment the function of which algorithm you want to see.
